# DiscordRingBot
For 1920x1080 displays

### Usage:
Run the program, type in how many people you wish to ring, and move your cursor over the top person in the member list.

### Issues:
- If someone is screensharing, it may not work completely.
- If someone has a display smaller than 1920x1080, it may not work properly.
- If your Windows or Discord is zoomed out/in, it won't work.
- If it tries to ring someone who is currently in the call, it won't ring anyone below them.
